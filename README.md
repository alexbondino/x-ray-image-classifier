## Introduction

In the field of medicine, early and accurate disease detection is of paramount importance to improve patient outcomes and provide effective treatment. Pneumonia is a serious respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The use of technology and machine learning has become a promising tool to enhance pneumonia detection through X-ray images. This project objective is to create a machine learning model that can detect pneumonia in x-ray images with a good accuracy and recall using the kaggle x-ray (pneumonia) dataset in this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. 

The output of this project will be a trained .pth model and a notebook with the full research.
