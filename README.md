## Introduction

In the field of medicine, early and accurate disease detection is of paramount importance to improve patient outcomes and provide effective treatment. Pneumonia is a serious respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The use of technology and machine learning has become a promising tool to enhance pneumonia detection through X-ray images. This project objective is to create a machine learning model that can detect pneumonia in x-ray images with a good accuracy and recall using the kaggle x-ray (pneumonia) dataset in this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. 

The output of this project will be a trained .pth model and a notebook with the full research.

## ¿How to use the model?
1. Create and activate a new environment  
   ```conda create --name x-ray python=3.8```  
   ```conda activate x-ray```  
3. Install the requirements  
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Download the .pth model.
5. Use the .pth model as you wish

## ¿How to use the notebook?
1. Create and activate a new environment.   
   ```conda create --name x-ray python=3.8```  
   ```conda activate x-ray```
2. Install the requirements  
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Clone the repository
4. Install and open jupyter lab.    
   ```conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab```  
   ```jupyter lab```
5. Feel free to play with the notebook as you wish.
